### based on information gleaned from metadata, a publication, 
### or when they are not immediately obvious for other reasons

	d$yield_moisture <- r$moisture * 100

#NOTE: yield is the _fresh weight_ production (kg/ha) of the "yield_part 
# Also record fresh and/or dry weight production of other organs (or "residue" or "total")
# if the data allow for that 

	d$fwy_storage <- r$yield_tonha * 1000
