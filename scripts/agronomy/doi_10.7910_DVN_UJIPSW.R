"Retaining crop residues in fields is a pathway to build SOM on smallholder farmers. The quality of crop residues can be improved through integrating more legume residues. This experiment assess the effect of legume residues from a doubled up system as compared to maize residues on rotational maize and N dynamics in the short term. In the long term, this can increase both quantity and quality of SOM"

##### Fertilizers #####
## From the publication experimental design
#Full rate fertilizer application (100%) = 69 kg/ha N, half-rate (50%) = 34.5 kg/ha N, and unfertilized maize had zero fertilizer (0%). For maize full rate fertilizer application, 100 kg/ha NP (23−21−0) was applied at planting, providing 23 kg/ha N and 9.2 kg/ha P. Four to six weeks after crop emergence, 100 kg/ha urea (46% N) was applied, providing 46 kg/ha N. Therefore, the full rate fertilizer regime provides about 9.2 kg/ha P and 69 kg/ha N. Doubled-up (an intercrop of two legumes that have different but compatible growth habits) or sole legumes were fertilized in the maize phase of the rotation at half the full rate.
